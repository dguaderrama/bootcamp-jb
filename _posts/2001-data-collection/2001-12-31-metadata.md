## Understanding the data you've just gathered

Metadata is a powerful source of data used in all areas of science and technology. This data (should) explain eveything about the data you've just gathered; how it was collected, accuracy of the data, who and when it was collected, etc. Good metadata adds more credibility to the data. Having an understanding of the importance of meta data will help you produce well documented data about data.

### The importance of spatial data metadata

Spatial data without metadata isn't useless but it doesn't help you get too far.
