#### **Pre-requisites: Installing QGIS, Is Spatial Special?**

#### **Objectives:**
  - Understand the difference between a raster and a vector dataset. 
  - Recognize a few spatial data formats.

#Rasters and Vectors
There are two main families of spatial data which are each used for a specific function. Vector data, which represents discrete phenomena such as bus stations, and Raster data which represents continuous phenomena like temperature.

##Vector<a name="vector"></a>

Vector data uses features \(features are usually points, lines or polygons\) to represent discrete phenomena in the real world. For example, a vector data file might include a river represented by a line which is assigned a value. For data which is associated with discrete entities like countries, landmarks, roads, etc. vector data is the way to go.

## Raster

Raster
  : a scan pattern in which an area is scanned 

Raster refers tp raster graphics.

Raster data is used to represent continuous phenemena in our world. Continuous phenomena have an assigned value at all positions on a surface. Raster data is commonly seen in satellite images. Satellite images are, simply put, pictures of the earth from space. Just like the pictures you can take with a hand-held digital camera, the information is in the pixels. Each pixel has a number value that can be translated into a color. Raster data si commonly output by sensors.<br><br>
