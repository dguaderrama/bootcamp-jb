### What is QGIS?
Straight from the horse's mouth:

> QGIS is the best GIS tool in the free and open-source software (FOSS) community.

> QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License. QGIS is an official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). It runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, Windows and Android and supports numerous vector, raster, and database formats and functionalities.

### Exlpore QGIS:

For a more thorough explanation of QGIS, <a href="http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/" target="new">see the QGIS User Guide here</a>.

#### The Basics

  ![QGIS GUI]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/qgis-gui.png)

1. ##### Menu Bar

The menu bar provides access to QGIS features. In Linux systems, hover over to view menu bar options (haven't checked other systems). The QGIS version is displayed while not hovering over the menu bar (linux systems).

2. ##### Toolbar

The toolbar provides access to most standard QGIS functions. Go to <em>Menu Bar > View > Toolbars</em> to activate or deactivate toolbars. Hover over tools to view the description and puropose.

3. ##### Map Legend

The map legend is a list of all layers in the project. Each layer can be turned on or off with the layer's checkbox.  It's possible to group layers.

4. ##### Map View 

The map view displays the active layers in the map project. You can set the map view extent by right-clicking on a layer and selecting <em>Zoom to layer extent</em>


5. ##### Status Bar 

The status bar displays current position in map coordiantes (e.g., meters or decimal degrees) as the mouse pointer moves across the map view. To the left of the coordinate display is the button gor toggling extents and mouse position display. To the right of the map coordinates is the scale, which may be set to one of the predefined zoom extends of 1:500 to 1:1,000,000. This scale setting will adjust as you zoom or pan throught the map view. Options for map rendering are to the right of the current map scale setting. To the far right is the current CRS for the map project.


6. ##### Processing Toolbox 
The processing toolbox must be turned on by naviagting to <em>Menu Bar > Processing > Toolbox</em>. This helpful tool allows searching by keyword for the geoalgorithm from each of the active processing roviders.[^2]

-------------------

<br>

#### Configure your workspace

##### Project properties

  ![QGIS Project Properties]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/project-properties.jpg)

<em>Menu Bar > Project > Project Properties</em>

From here you can set the title, save relative paths (default!), set canvas units, enable on-the-fly projection, etc. On-the-fly projection will project layers added to the project to the configured projection. 


##### Activate necessary providers

  ![Activate Providers]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/providers-config.jpg)

<em>Menu Bar > Processing > Options and configuration > Providers > $PROVIDER > Activate (be sure it's checked)</em>

[See the complete list of processing providers and algorithms here](http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/index.html?highlight=providers)

-------------------

<br>

### Working with Project Projections

> QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (coordinate reference system) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly (OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All of these features allow the user to display layers with different CRSs and have them overlay properly.[^2]

See [Intro to Spatial Data]({{site.baseurl}}/intro/spatial-data) for more detailed info on projections.

Each new project starts with the global default projection, EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 (```proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs```). This can be changed at <em>Menu Bar > Settings > Options > CRS > Default CRS for new projects</em>.

However, this is not the same as changing the project projection. You may define the project projection from <em>Menu Bar > Project > Project Properties > CRS</em>. Also keep in mind, the CRS of a new project will change to the CRS of the first layer added to the project.

'On the fly' CRS transformation is not enabled by the default QGIS installation.  


### General Spatial Functions
Below are general spatial functions performed in QGIS. Notice that while performing functions the GDAL command is dispalyed in the function window.

QGIS Module: Vector Analysis<br>

discuss meta data???

#### Reclassify and rasterize vector

What this module covers: 

 * importing vector layers
 * adding a column to vector data
 * reclassifying vector data
 * rasterizing vector data
 * product will be used in Vector Analysis

Prepare geology layer with geo_type (just an example) of soft, medium, hard, mass-wasting

Steps: 

 * Add field 'rock_strenght'
 * Reclassify as follows: 

 * soft = 1
 * medium = 2
 * hard = 3
 * mass-wasting = 1

 * rasterize geology layer

-----------------

<br>

#### Vector Analysis

What this module covers: 

 * buffer on polylines
 * intersecting vector layers
 * joining census data to vector layer

Research question: Where are high-risk landslide/mass-wasting areas near (select region).

High-risk area =

 * fo further than 50m from city boundaries
 * within 100m of fault lines
 * within 50m of rivers/streams
 * within soft geologic areas

Steps: 

 * buffer fault lines and rivers/streams
 * merge buffered fault lines with rivers/streams
 * join some data to something (census?)
 * intersect buffered-merged-joined data with reclassified-rasterized geology layer
 * product will be used in Raster Analysis

 * Intersect
 * Join
 * Merge
 * Buffer

---------------------

<br>

#### Raster Analysis

What this module covers: 

  * DEM Terrain analysis (slope, aspect)

Research question/objective: complete locating high-risk landslide/mass-wasting areas near (select region)

High-risk slope: 
 
 * numbers

High-risk aspect: 

 * numbers

Steps:

 * calc slope and aspect
 * raster calc (add) product from Vector Analysis with slope and aspect

Raster Statistics: 

 * histogram
 * zonal stats





 * Calculate slope and aspect
 * Raster Calculator
 * Interpolation
 * Zonal Statistics
 * Reclassify (covered in Reclassify and rasterize vector)
