### What is QGIS?
Straight from the horse's mouth:

> QGIS is the best GIS tool in the free and open-source software (FOSS) community.

> QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License. QGIS is an official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). It runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, Windows and Android and supports numerous vector, raster, and database formats and functionalities.

[Here's a link to download QGIS](http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)

<br>

### Exlpore QGIS:

For a more thorough explanation of QGIS, <a href="http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/" target="new">see the QGIS User Guide here</a>.

#### The Basics

  ![QGIS GUI]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/qgis-gui.png)

1. ##### **Menu Bar**
The menu bar provides access to QGIS features. In Linux systems, hover over to view menu bar options (haven't checked other systems). The QGIS version is displayed while not hovering over the menu bar (linux systems). Most common features or tools are accessable through the toolbar icons which will be the prefered method throughout this QGIS introduction.
2. ##### **Toolbar**
The toolbar provides access to most standard QGIS functions. Go to <em>Menu Bar > View > Toolbars</em> to activate or deactivate toolbars. Hover over tools to view the description and puropose.
3. ##### **Map Legend**
The map legend is a list of all layers in the project. Each layer can be turned on or off with the layer's checkbox.  It's possible to group layers.
4. ##### **Map View**
The map view displays the active layers in the map project. You can set the map view extent by right-clicking on a layer and selecting <em>Zoom to layer extent</em>
5. ##### **Status Bar**
The status bar displays current position in map coordiantes (e.g., meters or decimal degrees) as the mouse pointer moves across the map view. To the left of the coordinate display is the button gor toggling extents and mouse position display. To the right of the map coordinates is the scale, which may be set to one of the predefined zoom extends of 1:500 to 1:1,000,000. This scale setting will adjust as you zoom or pan throught the map view. Options for map rendering are to the right of the current map scale setting. To the far right is the current CRS for the map project.
6. ##### **Processing Toolbox**
The processing toolbox must be turned on by naviagting to <em>Menu Bar > Processing > Toolbox</em>. This helpful tool allows searching by keyword for the geoalgorithm from each of the active processing roviders.[^2]

-------------------

<br>

#### Configure your workspace

##### Project properties

  ![QGIS Project Properties]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/project-properties.jpg)

<em>Menu Bar > Project > Project Properties</em>

From here you can set the title, save relative paths (default!), set canvas units, enable on-the-fly projection, etc. On-the-fly projection will project layers added to the project to the configured projection. 


##### Activate necessary providers

  ![Activate Providers]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/providers-config.jpg)

<em>Menu Bar > Processing > Options and configuration > Providers > $PROVIDER > Activate (be sure it's checked)</em>

[See the complete list of processing providers and algorithms here](http://docs.qgis.org/2.6/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/index.html?highlight=providers)

-------------------

<br>

### Working with Project Projections

> QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (coordinate reference system) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly (OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All of these features allow the user to display layers with different CRSs and have them overlay properly.[^2]

See [Intro to Spatial Data]({{site.baseurl}}/intro/spatial-data) for more detailed info on projections.

Each new project starts with the global default projection, [EPSG:4326 - WGS 84](http://www.spatialreference.org/epsg/wgs-84/) (```proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs```). This can be changed at <em>Menu Bar > Settings > Options > CRS > Default CRS for new projects</em>.

However, this is not the same as changing the project projection. You may define the project projection from <em>Menu Bar > Project > Project Properties > CRS</em>. Also keep in mind, the CRS of a new project will change to the CRS of the first layer added to the project.

'On the fly' CRS transformation is not enabled by the default QGIS installation.  


### Supported Data Formats

QGIS support a multitude of data types from simple shapefiles to database tables to Web Feature Service layers. Sticking to the basics, below are quick descriptions of vector and raster data.

#### Vector 

QGIS uses the GDAL OGR library to read and write vector data formats, such as the most commonly known ESRI shapefile. GRASS vector and PostreSQL support is provided by a native QGIS provider plugin[^2]. [Here is the complete list of OGR vector formats](http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html).

Vector data is added to the project by simply clicking on the Add Vector Layer tool:

![Add vector in QGIS]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/add-vector.png)

View vector attribute table by right clicking on the layer and clicking Open Attribute Table. From here you can sort data, show selected features, show features visible on map, show edited and new features, filter by column, or query data with and advanced filter. 

Attribute data can be edited by enabling and edit session with the Toggle Editing Mode icon (top left).

#### Raster

QGIS uses the GDAL library to read and write raster data formats while GRASS raster support is provided by a native QGIS provider plugin[^2]. [Here is the complete list of GDAL raster formats](http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html).

Similar to adding vector data, click on the Add Raster Layer tool:

 ![Add raster in QGIS]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/add-raster.png)

### General Spatial Functions

Spatial functions are accessable through <em>Menu Bar > Vector/Raster</em>. Or alternatively, they are accesses through the Toolbox panel where searching for tools by keyword is made easy. 

> this is a note:
do we add simple raster and vector operations here, or save it for lessons?

### Composing Maps (for print/non-web-based)

This method is ideal for exporting your work for a research paper, admiring your work, and such. Developing a web map for dissimenating your data is a bit more involved and is discussed in the [Publish Your Data to a Web Mapi/LeafletJS]({{site.baseurl}}/visualization/leaflet) section. Also, to export data with styles see [This section link](this-is-not-a-link).

Begin by opening the Print Composer: 

 ![Create new Print Composer workspace]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/compose-map.png)

this is just and idea for lessons

### Lessons

Lessons are intended for learning basic spatial functions with QGIS. Each lesson is a prerequisite for the subsequent lesson. For best results, start from beginning to end from collecting data throught visualizing the final product. However, data will be prepared and available if you wish to jump through lessons without completing the former.

DISCLAIMER: Data provided here have been reclassified/modified to fit the needs of the lessons and should not be used in any scientific analysis. Original data sources and researh articles are available if you feel the need to pursue your dreams of performing a landslide susceptibility analysis. [Original data and research articles are located here]({{site.baseurl}}/references/citations).

The Scenario:

You've been assigned the task of locating high-risk landslide areas in the state of Washington, specifically the densely population northwest region. You must locate and prepare your data before performing your analysis. The Governor of Washington also wants to make this data publicaly through an online web map. 

-----------------

<br>

#### Data Collection

What this lesson covers:

 * downloading data
 * downloading meta data
 * file storage/project directory (keep your data directories clean)


Data sources:

 * US Census - American Fact Finder (real estate): http://factfinder.census.gov/
 * US Census - TIGER/Line (shapefiles and geodatabases): http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html

Steps: 

 * download data with meta data (DEM & washingon boundary data with meta data)
 * prepare project directory
 * data will be used in Data Prep

-----------------

<br>

#### Data Prep

What this lesson covers:

 * reprojecting data
 * clipping data extents
 * importing data (raster and vector)

Download, examine, and prepare DEM for landslide susceptibility analysis.

Data:
 * gtopo30 DEM - northwest america

Steps:

 * import DEM of northwest US
 * import washington boundary shapefile
 * clip DEM to washington boundary
 * data will be used in Reclassify and Rasterize Vector

-----------------

<br>

#### Reclassify and Rasterize Vector

What this module covers: 

 * editing vector data attributes
 * (re)classifying vector data
 * rasterizing vector data

Prepare geology layer with geo_type (just an example) of soft, medium, hard, mass-wasting

Data:
 * washington state geology shapefile

Steps: 

 1.  Import wa_geology.shp:
   * <em>Open QGIS, Add Vector Layer, and navigate to wa_geology.shp.</em><br>
 ![QGIS: Add geology vector layer into map view]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/lesson-1/lesson-1-01.png)
 2.  Open field calculator in Attribute Table:
   * <em>Right-click wa_geology in Layers List > Open Attribute Table > Toggle editing mode (top left)</em>
   * While in edit mode, <em>Open field calculator (top right)</em><br>
![QGIS: Open field calcultor]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/lesson-1/lesson-1-03.png)
 3.  Add and calculate new field:
   * Match your Field Calculator window to the one below for creating a new field 'strength' with a range of values of 0-3. Be sure to match it exactly as it's displayed: double-quotes are recognized as a column whereas single-quotes are recongnized as column values. Save your changes once finished.
    Expression:
    case
    when "rock_type" = 'soft' then 1
    when "rock_type" = 'medium' then 2
    when "rock_type" = 'hard' then 3
    else 0
    done
   ![QGIS: Add and calculate new field]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/lesson-1/lesson-1-04.png)
 4. Style wa_geology.shp:
   * <em>Right-click on wa_geology.shp in layer list > Properties > Style</em>
   * Change style type from <em>Single Symbol</em> to <em>Categorized</em>.
   * Categorize by <em>strength</em> and click <em>Classify</em> to add classes.
   * Match your colors with the example below or get fancy with your own styling.<br>
   ![QGIS: Style shapefile]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/lesson-1/lesson-1-07.png)
 5. Rasterize wa_geology.shp:
   * GDAL's rasterize is a prefered method. This can be accessed through <em>Menu Bar > Raster > Conversion > Rasterize (Vector to raster)</em>. Notice how the parameters have been diabled in the example below. There's a specific reason for this. Complete the parameter inputs: <em>Define your output file and location (in working directory); Attribute field = strength; Raster size in pixels = 1000 x 1000</em>. Because GDAL is more powerful in the commandline, there are certain parameters that cannot be set within QGIS.
   * <em>Click the edit icon (pencil) locate near the block of code</em>. This enables you to add those non-QGIS parameters.
   * <em>Add the line of code ```-at -a_nodata 0```</em> just after ```gdal_rasterize```. 
   * <em>-at</em>: Enables the ALL_TOUCHED rasterization option so that all pixels touched by lines or polygons will be updated, not just those on the line render path, or whose center point is within the polygon. Defaults to disabled for normal rendering rules.[^3]
   * <em>-a_nodata $value</em>: Assign a specified nodata value to output bands - this prevents pixels with no data from being written into the output raster.[^3]
   * [Here's a link to the gdal_rasterize parameters](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_rasterize.html).<br>
   ![QGIS: Rasterize - Vector to raster]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/lesson-1/lesson-1-11-2.png)
 6. Style the new wa_geology.tif:
   * Open wa_geology.tif style properties. HINT: See step 4.
   * For <em>Render type</em>, select <em>Singleband pseudocolor</em>
   * On the right select: <em>Load min/max values: Min/max; Extend: Actual (slower); then Load</em>. This loads actual values into the classification. QGIS Approximates values by defautl. 
   * <em>Change Mode to Equal Interval with 3 classes</em>. Remember, we only have three rock strength classes: soft, medium, hard. Change your color map if you'd like. The color maps are not stored into the raster, so the raster will load with the defaul color map (black to white) each time its opened in a new project.
   * <em>Click Classify</em>. Apply and OK.<br>
   ![QGIS: Style raster]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}/images/lesson-1/lesson-1-13.png)

You've just successfully imported a vector, added and calculated a new field, styled a vector layer, rasterized a vector with GDAL, and finished it off with styling a raster. 

Keep this reclassified and rasterized vector, it'll be used in the next lesson.
