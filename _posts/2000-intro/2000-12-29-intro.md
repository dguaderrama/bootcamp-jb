#Intro to Spatial Data
Spatial data is created as simply as adding a column of geographical location to your table. There are two types of spatial data: vector and raster.

##Vector<a name="vector"></a>

Vector data contains features \(features are usually points, lines or polygons\) which represent things in the real world. For example, a vector data file might include a river represented by a line. Now that whole line can contain information about the river \(as opposed to defining that information pixel by pixel\). For data which is associated with categorical data or entities like countries, mountains, roads, etc. vector data is the way to go.

## Raster

Raster data is most recognizable as a satellite image. Satellite images are, simply put, pictures of the earth from space. Just like the pictures you can take with a hand-held digital camera, the information is in the pixels. Each pixel has a number value that translates into a color. Raster data is good for investigating what is happening on earth in real time, or for data which is continuous.<br><br>

##Projections <a name="projections"></a>
Projections characterize spatial data by setting coordinate reference systems for each data set.

Each projection is defined on top of a geographic coordinate system or spheroid based off of two ellipsoids, major and minor axes. These geographic coordinates systems deliver the coordinates in degrees and account for the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere.
 will convert the 3d spheroid of the earth into a 2-dimensional representation. Each projection type utilitizes a different technique to project the earth\'s image onto a plane. 

####Projections can come in a variety of forms:

#####Conic

It is important to check the projection of your data to make sure they share the same projection prior to performing any spatial analysis.

<a href="http://spatialreference.org" target="new">SpatialReference.org</a> is an extremely useful resource that houses definitions for all official projections in a variety of formats. This is a great place to find proj4 strings. 

  <a href="http://spatialreference.org" target="new">![SpatialReference.org: EPSG:4326]({{site.baseurl}}{{ASSET_PATH}}images/spatialreference.png)</a>

Since there are a few thousand different projections, with their own area of interest, it is likely that you will come upon datasets with different projection in your project. The easiest way to resolve projection disputes is to decide on the projection for your project before gathering data and save the proj4 string assigned to the projection. This string will allow you to project your datasets to the proper coordinate reference system.<br><br>

_NOTE: When reprojecting a raster, you should also resample your raster to ensure that the cells have the same width and height. The cells will distort in the new projection and most GIS software will refuse to read a raster with irregular cells._

##Common Data Formats
The goal of your project will ultimately define whether you use raster or vector data. Here are some common data formats you may encounter:

 * Shapefile: Stores point, line, and polygon data. This file type is actually made up of a collection of files with the following endings: These are mandatory: .shp, .shx, .dbf There are many others which are optional, including the important .prj file that describes the projection information for that data.
 * GeoTIFF: A standard that allows embedding geographic information in a TIFF file.
 * NetCDF: A multidimensional data format that allows for multiple variables covering 1 or more dimensions.
 * Arcinfo/Ascii grid: Proprietary format by Esri
 * Geodatabase: Esri proprietary spatial database. Very easy to load data into, not so easy to extract.
 * GeoJSON: Encodes points, lines, and polygons (and collections of those) along with information about them using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This format is popular for web maps.
 * Database: There are various databases that, with extensions, can hold geographic objects. Some notable examples are PostgreSQL with PostGIS, and SQLite with the SpatiaLite extension. It is important to look into the level of spatial support within a database before performing any analysis. For example, MySQL\'s spatial extension has geometry support, but the geometries are all defined by bounding boxes rather than the true geometry.
