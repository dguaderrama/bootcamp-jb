#Rasters and Vectors
There are two main families of spatial data which are each used for a specific function. Vector data, which represents discrete phenomena such as bus stations, and Raster data which represents continuous phenomena like temperature.

##Vector<a name="vector"></a>

Vector data uses features \(features are usually points, lines or polygons\) to represent discrete phenomena in the real world. For example, a vector data file might include a river represented by a line which is assigned a value. For data which is associated with discrete entities like countries, landmarks, roads, etc. vector data is the way to go.

## Raster

Raster data is used to represent continuous phenemena in our world. Continuous phenomena have an assigned value at all positions on a surface. Raster data is commonly seen in satellite images. Satellite images are, simply put, pictures of the earth from space. Just like the pictures you can take with a hand-held digital camera, the information is in the pixels. Each pixel has a number value that can be translated into a color. Raster data si commonly output by sensors.<br><br>

##Common Data Formats
 Here are some common data formats you may encounter:

 * Shapefile: Stores point, line, and polygon data. This file type is actually made up of a collection of files with the following endings: These are mandatory: .shp, .shx, .dbf There are many others which are optional, including the important .prj file that describes the projection information for that data.
 * Geodatabase: Esri proprietary spatial database. Very easy to load data into, not so easy to extract.
 * GeoJSON: Encodes points, lines, and polygons (and collections of those) along with information about them using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This format is popular for web maps.
 * GeoTIFF: A standard that allows embedding geographic information in a TIFF file.
 * NetCDF: A multidimensional data format that allows for multiple variables covering 1 or more dimensions.
 * Arcinfo/Ascii grid: Proprietary format by Esri
 * Database: There are various databases that, with extensions, can hold geographic objects. Some notable examples are PostgreSQL with PostGIS, and SQLite with the SpatiaLite extension. It is important to look into the level of spatial support within a database before performing any analysis. For example, MySQL\'s spatial extension has geometry support, but the geometries are all defined by bounding boxes rather than the true geometry.
