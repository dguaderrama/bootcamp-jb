## Colors are important

Colors can add meaning and beauty to your data, but it is important to select an appropriate color scheme for your goals. For example, for a choropleth map, you should use a monochromatic color scheme.

Color blindness is important factor when selecting color schemes.

[ColorBrewer 2.0](http://colorbrewer2.org/) is an excellent cartography tool for selecting colors and saving time. It considers colorblindness which should always be an important factor when selecting color schemes.

Grey scale maps for non-color-based printed maps.

Tools like [paletton.com](http://paletton.com/) are simply a color wheel that help the color picking process. Paletton.com has options such as monochromatic, adjacent colors, triad, and tetrad that pick colors based on a single color selection. This is actually meant for web designing but has the same prinicple of color theory.
